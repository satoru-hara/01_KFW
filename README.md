# 01_KFW - Kinetic Framework for the Whole Body

KFW (Kinetic Framework for the Whole Body) is a system focused on physical capability, movement principles, and foundational body mechanics.  
It provides a structured approach to understanding and improving human movement through six independent but interconnected books.

This section represents the "body layer" of Satoru Hara's overall architecture, forming the most concrete and practical foundation among the three major systems.

Foundational principles of fitness, physical conditioning, and movement preparation.  
Provides the conceptual base for all subsequent KFW materials.

### 02_Original-Squat
A complete methodology for the Original Squat, including mechanics, alignment, and execution principles.

### 03_Essential-Twelve
Twelve essential movement patterns that form the core of functional human motion.

### 04_Core-Breathing
Breathing mechanics and their role in stability, movement efficiency, and physical performance.

### 05_Core-Stabilization
A structured approach to understanding and training core stability as the center of all movement.

### 06_Original-Squat-Technical-Note
Technical notes and detailed clarifications that support the Original Squat methodology.

## Structure

- Each folder contains a readme.md explaining its purpose  
- Each book folder includes a PDF (the full text)  
- Numbering ensures clarity, order, and reproducibility  
- KFW is organized strictly by book units, not by layers or modules

## Purpose of KFW

KFW defines the physical foundation of human capability.  
It establishes the movement principles that support higher-level systems such as NAW (work architecture) and HNS (human and civilization structure).

This section is designed to be practical, applicable, and directly connected to real human movement.
