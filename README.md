# 01_KFW - Kinetic Fitness Series
The Kinetic Fitness Series is a collection of six works produced under KFW (Kinetic Fitness Works).
This series focuses on physical capability, movement principles, and foundational body mechanics.
It provides a structured approach to understanding and improving human movement through six independent but interconnected books.

This section represents the "body layer" of Satoru Hara's overall architecture, forming the most concrete and practical foundation among the three major systems.

Included Books

01_Fitness-Framework
  Foundational principles of fitness, physical conditioning, and movement preparation.
  Provides the conceptual base for all subsequent KFW materials.

02_Original-Squat
  A complete methodology for the Original Squat, including mechanics, alignment, and execution principles.

03_Essential-Twelve
  Twelve essential movement patterns that form the core of functional human motion.

04_Core-Breathing
  Breathing mechanics and their role in stability, movement efficiency, and physical performance.

05_Core-Stabilization
  A structured approach to understanding and training core stability as the center of all movement.

06_Original-Squat-Technical-Note
  Technical notes and detailed clarifications that support the Original Squat methodology.

Purpose of the Kinetic Fitness Series

The Kinetic Fitness Series defines the physical foundation of human capability.
It establishes the movement principles that support higher-level systems such as NAW (work architecture) and HNS (human and civilization structure).

This section is designed to be practical, applicable, and directly connected to real human movement.
